# API-Sales

Hi. This app is a result of the course # [API Restful Javascript com Node.js, Typescript, TypeORM, etc](https://www.udemy.com/course/api-restful-de-vendas/) promoted by Udemy. The idea was to have more "hands-on" with some technologies and to improve some skills that I have.

## The project
This project is an implementation of an API to simulate API sales. Here some features like CRUD users, CRUD products, manage sales, and authentication was implemented using good practices and trying to extract the best of the libs used.


## Technologies

During the course libraries like TypeORM, Node, Express, Redis, Joi and etc were presented to us.
